## 1. Introduction to Databases

### 1.1 Definition
A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), which allow for the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.

### 1.2 Importance of Databases
- Centralized data management
- Efficient data retrieval
- Data integrity and security
- Scalability for growing datasets

### 1.3 Types of Databases
- **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data; examples include MySQL and Oracle.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data; examples include MongoDB and Cassandra.
- **NewSQL Databases**: Combine the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID guarantees of traditional SQL databases.

## 2. Database Design

### 2.1 Requirements Analysis
Before creating a database, gather requirements to understand the data that will be stored, user needs, and system constraints.

### 2.2 Data Modeling
#### 2.2.1 Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
Visual representation of entities in a database and their relationships. It helps in understanding the structure of the data.

#### 2.2.2 Normalization
The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It typically involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.

### 2.2.3 Schema Design
#### 2.2.3.1 Tables
Define the structure of tables, including columns, data types, and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).

#### 2.2.3.1 Relationships
Establish how tables relate to one another (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

## 3. Database Management Systems (DBMS)

### 3.1 Overview of DBMS
A DBMS is software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data.

### 3.2 Types of DBMS
- 3.2.1 **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: Organizes data into tables; uses SQL for data manipulation.
- 3.2.2 **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational; suitable for big data and real-time web applications.
- 3.2.3 **NewSQL Databases**: Aim to provide the scalability of NoSQL while maintaining the consistency and reliability of traditional RDBMS.

### 3.3 Comparison of Popular DBMS
| Feature        | MySQL          | PostgreSQL     | MongoDB        | Oracle         |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Type           | RDBMS          | RDBMS          | NoSQL          | RDBMS          |
| ACID Compliance | Yes            | Yes            | Limited        | Yes            |
| Use Cases      | Web applications| Complex queries | Real-time analytics | Enterprise applications |

## 4. Database Implementation

### 4.1 Installing a DBMS
Instructions for installing popular DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB on various platforms.

### 4.2 Creating a Database
Steps to create a new database using SQL commands or a graphical interface.

### 4.3 Defining Tables and Data Types
How to create tables and specify data types for each column (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE).

### 4.4 Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data
Basic SQL commands for manipulating data within the database.

## 5. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### 5.1 SQL Basics
#### 5.1.1 SELECT
Retrieves data from one or more tables.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
```

#### 5.1.2 INSERT
Adds new records to a table.
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name, country) VALUES ('John Doe', 'USA');
```

#### 5.1.3 UPDATE
Modifies existing records in a table.
```sql
UPDATE customers SET country = 'Canada' WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

#### 5.1.4 DELETE
Removes records from a table.
```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

### 5.2 Joins and Subqueries
- **Joins**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries that provide results for the outer query.

## 6. Database Security

### 6.1 User Management
Creating and managing user accounts, roles, and permissions to control access to the database.

### 6.2 Authentication and Authorization
Implementing measures to verify user identity and grant or deny access based on roles.

### 6.3 Data Encryption
Techniques for securing sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### 6.4 Backup and Recovery Strategies
Methods for backing up data and recovering it in case of failure or corruption.

## 7. Database Performance Tuning

### 7.1 Indexing
Creating indexes to improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.

### 7.2 Query Optimization
Techniques to enhance SQL queries for better performance.

### 7.3 Database Partitioning
Dividing a database into smaller, manageable pieces to improve performance and maintenance.

### 7.4 Monitoring and Profiling Tools
Tools to monitor database performance and analyze query execution.

## 8. Data Integrity and Transactions

### 8.1 ACID Properties
- 8.1.1 **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
- 8.1.2 **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state after transactions.
- 8.1.3 **Isolation**: Transactions operate independently of each other.
- 8.1.4 **Durability**: Completed transactions are permanent.

### 8.2 Transactions and Concurrency Control
Managing multiple transactions to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts.

### 8.3 Isolation Levels
Different settings for how transactions interact with one another (e.g., Read Committed, Serializable).

## 9. Backup and Recovery

### 9.1 Types of Backups
#### 9.1.1 Full Backup
A complete copy of the entire database.

#### 9.1.2 Incremental Backup
Only backs up data that has changed since the last backup.

### 9.1.3 Recovery Strategies
Methods for restoring data from backups in the event of data loss.

### 9.1.4 Disaster Recovery Planning
Creating a strategy to recover from catastrophic events affecting the database.

## 10. Database Maintenance

### 10.1 Routine Maintenance Tasks
Regular activities to keep the database running smoothly, such as updating statistics and rebuilding indexes.
